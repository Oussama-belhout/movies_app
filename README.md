# Movies App

This repository contains a React application built with Vite. The application allows users to browse popular movies, search for movies, and manage a list of favorite movies. The project showcases various React concepts and techniques, providing an opportunity to gain hands-on experience with advanced React features and best practices.

## Features

1. **Props and Their Propagation:** I could deepen my understanding of how to effectively pass objects and data between components.
2. **Named and Default Exports:** I could learn when and how to utilize named and default exports in JavaScript modules to organize my codebase.
3. **Client-Side Routing:** I could master client-side routing using `BrowserRouter` from `react-router-dom` to enable seamless navigation within the application.
4. **Local Storage Manipulation:** I could explore techniques for caching data in local storage and managing it before interacting with a persistence layer.
5. **Array Methods:** I could gain practical experience with advanced array methods, such as the `.some()` method, for data validation and manipulation.
6. **useState Hook:** I could understand how to use the `useState` hook for managing dynamic state within React components.
7. **useEffect Hook:** I could learn how to use the `useEffect` hook for initializing data, handling side effects, and responding to dependency changes.
8. **useContext Hook:** I could build skills in using the `useContext` hook to share and manage global data across components with a context provider.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Oussama-belhout/movies_app.git
   cd movies-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Key Concepts

### Props and Their Propagation
This project provided me with hands-on experience in passing data and objects from parent to child components, demonstrating how to structure and manage component communication effectively.

### Named and Default Exports
I could learn the practical differences between named and default exports, and understand how to leverage them for better module organization and reusability.

### Client-Side Routing
I gained expertise in implementing client-side routing with `react-router-dom`, creating a smooth and interactive user experience by linking routes to components.

### Local Storage Manipulation
I could understand how to use local storage to temporarily store data such as favorite movies, enabling persistent user preferences and faster data access.

### Array Methods
I practiced using array methods like `.some()` for efficiently handling and validating data in real-world applications.

### useState Hook
I learned to manage dynamic state changes within React components, such as updating the list of favorite movies or handling user input.

### useEffect Hook
I mastered the `useEffect` hook to handle data fetching, synchronize state with external sources, and manage side effects in React applications.

### useContext Hook
I developed the ability to manage shared application state with the `useContext` hook, creating a scalable and maintainable approach to global state management.
